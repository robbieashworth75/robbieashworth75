My name is Robbie Ashworth, and I have lived in Wilmington, NC since March 2021 after moving from Huntington, WV. I will be starting Tech Elevator National Live Remote program on May 15, 2023 in order to facilitate a midlife career change. I've dabbled in coding and web development for a number of years, but have never pursued it as a possible career. I'm excited for both the challenges and possibilities ahead!
